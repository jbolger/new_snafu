# new_snafu
A simple GTK implimentation of the game "SNAFU", simillar to Snake.  This is some code from 2011 I wrote for a college assignment.  It comes as is, it is unlikely to be updated.

When I find the documentation file I made, it will be posted here too.

You should be able to complile this with `make` provided you have the correct libraries installed.  Otherwise, see `main.c` for a more specific build command.
